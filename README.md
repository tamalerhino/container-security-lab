# Container Security Lab

This repository demonstrates a secure container pipeline using GitHub Actions. The goal is to showcase security best practices at each stage of the software supply chain, focusing on containerization.

## Key Concepts

- **Software Supply Chain Security**: Protecting the software delivery process from development to deployment.
- **Containerization**: Building, scanning, signing, and validating containers to ensure the integrity of your application.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **CodeQL Static Analysis (SAST)**: Analyze the source code for vulnerabilities.
2. **Build and Push Docker Image**: Build the container and push it to DockerHub.
3. **Trivy Scan (SCA)**: Scan the Docker image for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
4. **Sign Docker Image with Cosign**: Sign the container to verify integrity.
5. **Validate Image Signature**: Ensure the image hasn't been tampered with.
6. **Generate SBOM**: Create a Software Bill of Materials to track dependencies.

## Tools Used

- **[CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql-action)**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
- **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action)**: Vulnerability scanner for containers.
- **[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)**: Tool for signing and verifying container images.
- **[SBOM](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action)**: Generate and manage SBOMs.

## Workflow Configuration

Here's a quick breakdown of the steps in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

         with:
           category: "/language:javascript-typescript"
   ```

2. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   ```yaml
   build-push:
     name: Build and Push Container Image
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: codeql
     steps:
       - name: Set up Docker Buildx
         uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
       - name: Login to Dockerhub
         uses: docker/login-action@v3
         with:
           username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
           password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
       - name: Build and Publish Container Image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
         with:
           push: true
           tags: |
             ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}
   ```

3. **Trivy Vulnerability Scan**:
   ```yaml
   trivy:
     name: Run Trivy Scan
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: build-push
     steps:
       - name: Install Trivy
         uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
         with:
           image-ref: '${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}'
           format: 'table'
           exit-code: '1'
           ignore-unfixed: true
           vuln-type: 'os,library'
           severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
   ```

4. **Sign Image with Cosign**:
   ```yaml
   sign:
     name: Sign Container Image with Cosign
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: trivy
     steps:
       - name: Login to Dockerhub
         uses: docker/login-action@v3
         with:
           username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
           password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
       - name: Install Cosign
         uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.7.0
       - name: Sign Container Image
         run: |
             cosign sign --yes --key env://COSIGN_KEY ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}
         env:
           COSIGN_KEY: ${{secrets.COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY}}
           COSIGN_PASSWORD: ${{secrets.COSIGN_PASSWORD}}
   ```

   ```yaml
   validate-container:
     name: Validate Container Image
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: sign

       - name: Install Cosign
         uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.7.0

         run: 'echo "$KEY" > cosign.key'
         env:
           KEY: ${{ secrets.COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY }}

         run: |
           cosign verify --key cosign.key ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}
       - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
